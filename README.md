# Not NaNo Game
A game to learn more about game dev. I'm envisioning an RTS/Tower Defense/Base-Builder.

Originally intended to use Panda3d, a top-down version is easier than isometric, so a pure 2D engine with cocos2d was chosen instead.

I guess I should rename the repo...

I'm [blogging](https://creativemisconfiguration.wordpress.com/) as I go along.
